simple tools in C, Shell, and Awk

This project is mostly so I can practice C, shell scripting, and Awk since I've become thoroughly intrigued with DevOps/systems programming. The scripts included in the first commit are all rather simple, but I promise that they will become more complex and useful as my knowledge of this area of programming develops over time.

## Use
You can download the source of this project by simply clicking on the "Clone or Download" button. For now, you will need to manually allow execution permissions for each one before using it:
```shell
chmod +x <script name>
```

I will eventually be writing a brew formula for simpler installation which includes automatic execution permission. If I can't do the ladder part, then I will simply create and include a script for this project that will do so.

## Contribute
I'd be more than happy if you wanted to collaborate with me on additional scripts in this useful bundle. Just send me an email at scsandman6496@gmail.com.

I have a lot more planned for the future; the more people with whom to collaborate, the better.
