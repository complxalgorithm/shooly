simple tools in C, Shell, and Awk

This project is mostly so I can practice C, shell scripting, and Awk since I've become thoroughly intrigued with DevOps/systems programming. The scripts included in the first commit are all rather simple, but I promise that they will become more complex and useful as my knowledge of this area of programming develops over time.

## Contribute
I'd be more than happy if you wanted to collaborate with me on additional scripts in this useful bundle. Just send me an email at scsandman6496@gmail.com.

I have a lot more planned for the future; the more people with whom to collaborate, the better.

## Things Used in Development
* C
* Bash
